The @gvps@ plugin provides a tag library which is one of the primary methods of using the plugin after the [Movie|Domain] domain objects have been created. All tags for this plugin are available in the @vid:@ namespace.

Two tags in a gsp are required to display a video. The first is the [includes|Tags] tag, which is placed in the @<head>@ of the page to pull in the appropriate video player library. The specific library used is specified with the @player@ attribute, which must be set to either @'jwflv'@ or @'flowplayer'@.

The second tag is the [display|Tags] tag, which is inserted into the markup of the body to render the player object. The @player@ attribute is again used to specify the type of player and the @id@ or @movie@ attribute is used to specify the video to be displayed. Additional attributes are used to specify whether to stream the video and its size.

Lastly, the [convertVideoPlaytime|Tags] tag is used to render video play times in readable form.
