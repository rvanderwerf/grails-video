This plugin provides facilities for converting video formats and streaming videos from a Grails application.

To do so, it provides the following primary functions:

# A @Movie@ domain object to represent movies which are stored on the local file system.
# A tag library to display videos on a page as well as include required libraries.
# Controllers and views for uploading, managing, and showing movies.
# A @VideoService@ to manage movie files stored on the file system, convert movie formats, and stream their contents to clients.

These functions provide a ready-to-use package for uploading and streaming videos from your Grails application. 

Two video player libraries are presently supported. The 
[JW-FLV player|http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/] is used to serve content in flv files, whereas the [Flowplayer|http://flowplayer.org/] is used to serve content in mp4 files. 

Most video formats which are understood by the [ffmpeg|http://ffmpeg.org] program can be uploaded and will be converted into the flv and mp4 formats used by the plugin to serve content.

This plugin was originally developed as the Cantina Consulting pre-1.0 Grails Plugin, and was converted to be compatible with Grails 2 by Ryan Vanderwerf and Burt Beckwith.
